Here’s the data flow of your program:

1. When your app starts, it dispatches the fetchPosts action in the useEffect hook.
2. The fetchPosts action is an async thunk that makes a GET request to ‘https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts’ using axios.
3. While the request is pending, redux toolkit automatically dispatches a fetchPosts.pending action, which sets state.loading to ‘loading’.
4. If the request is successful, redux toolkit automatically dispatches a fetchPosts.fulfilled action with the response data as the payload. This sets state.loading to ‘succeeded’ and replaces state.entities with the response data.
5. If the request fails, redux toolkit automatically dispatches a fetchPosts.rejected action with the error as the payload. This sets state.loading to ‘failed’ and replaces state.entities with the error message.
6. The fetched posts are then displayed in your app. If state.loading is ‘loading’, it shows a loading message. Otherwise, it maps over state.entities (which should be an array of posts) and displays each post.
7. When you click the “Create Post” button, it dispatches the createPosts action with a new post as the argument.
8. The createPosts action is another async thunk that makes a POST request to ‘https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts’ with the new post as the body.
9. If this request is successful, redux toolkit automatically dispatches a createPosts.fulfilled action with the response data as the payload. This replaces state.entities with the response data (which is just the new post).
10. The new post then replaces all existing posts in your app.
